## Admin dashboard setup

The admin dashboard uses **Supabase Auth** and **RLS**: only users with the `admin` role can read questionnaire responses. No Edge Function is called for loading responses, so there are no CORS issues.

1. **Create an admin user** in Supabase: Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Add user (e.g. email `admin@nairobischool.com`, password of your choice).
2. **Grant the admin role**: In Supabase SQL Editor run (replace `USER_UUID` with the new user’s id from Authentication → Users):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES ('USER_UUID', 'admin');
   ```
3. Sign in at `/admin` with that email and password.
